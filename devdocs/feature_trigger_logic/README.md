# Feature Trigger Logic Documentation

This directory contains detailed documentation about what triggers detection for each VideoKurt feature, particularly focused on screen recording scenarios.

## Purpose

Understanding what triggers each feature helps:
- Select the right features for your analysis
- Interpret results correctly
- Avoid features that don't work well with screen recordings
- Optimize parameters for your use case

## Feature Categories

### üéØ High-Value for Screen Recordings

These features work excellently with screen recordings:

- [**scrolling_detection.md**](scrolling_detection.md) - Purpose-built for UI scrolling patterns
- [**stability_score.md**](stability_score.md) - Detects idle periods and reading time
- [**scene_detection.md**](scene_detection.md) - Identifies application/page switches
- [**dwell_time_maps.md**](dwell_time_maps.md) - Shows static vs dynamic regions
- [**edge_density.md**](edge_density.md) - Distinguishes text from media content
- [**repetition_indicator.md**](repetition_indicator.md) - Finds loading states and loops
- [**temporal_activity_patterns.md**](temporal_activity_patterns.md) - Reveals work rhythms

### üìä General Activity Metrics

Universal features that work across all video types:

- [**motion_magnitude.md**](motion_magnitude.md) - Overall activity level
- [**binary_activity.md**](binary_activity.md) - Simple active/idle detection
- [**activity_bursts.md**](activity_bursts.md) - Intense activity periods
- [**spatial_occupancy_grid.md**](spatial_occupancy_grid.md) - Where activity occurs

### üé• Motion Analysis

Features that track movement patterns:

- [**motion_trajectories.md**](motion_trajectories.md) - Path tracking
- [**boundary_crossing.md**](boundary_crossing.md) - Objects crossing lines

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited Use for Screen Recordings

These features are designed for physical video and have limited utility for screen recordings:

- [**blob_tracking.md**](blob_tracking.md) - Tracks "objects" (poor for UI)
- [**blob_stability.md**](blob_stability.md) - Object persistence (noisy for UI)

## How to Use This Documentation

1. **Start with your goal** - What do you want to detect?
2. **Check high-value features first** - These are optimized for screen recordings
3. **Read trigger conditions** - Understand what activates detection
4. **Review limitations** - Know what won't work
5. **Check output format** - Understand what data you'll get

## Common Screen Recording Patterns

- Thresholds often need adjustment for screen content
- Resolution and frame rate affect many features
- Compression artifacts can trigger false positives
