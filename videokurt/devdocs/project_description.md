# VideoKurt - Project Description

## What are we building?

VideoKurt is a computer vision module that performs mechanical analysis of video content through frame-level inspection. It acts as a pre-processing layer that marks visual changes, detects predefined patterns, and creates activity timelines without understanding semantic meaning.

Think of VideoKurt as a "video scanner" that identifies WHEN and WHERE scenes change, providing structured metadata about visual activity that higher-level systems can interpret.

## What problem are we solving?

### The Core Problem
Video analysis is computationally expensive and inefficient when every frame needs to be processed by expensive AI models. Most video content contains:
- Long idle periods with no meaningful activity
- Redundant frames during slow actions
- Predictable UI patterns that don't need AI interpretation
- Loading screens and wait states that waste processing time

### Current Approach Problems
- **Blind Processing**: Analyzing every frame equally, regardless of importance
- **Wasted Resources**: Sending idle/loading frames to expensive LLM APIs
- **No Context**: Each frame analyzed in isolation without temporal awareness
- **Manual Inspection**: Developers manually identifying important moments

### Our Solution
VideoKurt provides intelligent pre-filtering by:
- Identifying active vs inactive periods automatically
- Detecting mechanical events (scrolls, clicks, scene changes)
- Marking boundaries where important changes occur
- Creating structured timelines for efficient processing
- Enabling "skip zones" to avoid processing dead time

## What are the various scopes of this project?

### Core Scope - Mechanical Detection
- Binary activity tracking (active/inactive periods)
- Scene change detection and boundaries
- Basic UI event detection (scroll, click, popup)
- Frame similarity and difference analysis
- Activity intensity measurement

### Extended Scope - Pattern Recognition
- Custom template matching for specific UI elements
- Loading indicator and spinner detection
- Image detection within videos (user-provided reference images)
- Motion pattern analysis (swipes, gestures)
- Screen region tracking

### Advanced Scope - Optimization Features
- Adaptive sampling recommendations
- Multi-resolution processing
- GPU acceleration support
- Streaming/real-time analysis
- Caching and incremental processing

### Out of Scope
- Semantic understanding (what actions mean)
- Audio analysis
- Text extraction/OCR
- Decision making or validation
- Video editing or modification
- Multi-video correlation
