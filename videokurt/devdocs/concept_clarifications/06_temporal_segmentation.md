# Temporal Segmentation

## What It Is and Why It Matters
Temporal segmentation is the division of video into logical chunks based on activity density and event boundaries. It matters because it enables intelligent batch processing, allowing downstream systems to apply different analysis strategies to different parts of the video based on their characteristics.

## How This Helps the Overall Project
Temporal segmentation enables VideoKurt to:
- Provide natural processing boundaries for long videos
- Enable adaptive sampling strategies per segment
- Support parallel processing of independent segments
- Create logical units for caching and resumption
- Facilitate progressive video analysis
- Optimize resource allocation based on segment importance

## How This Limits the Overall Project
Temporal segmentation constraints:
- May split related events across segment boundaries
- Requires arbitrary decisions about segment size
- Cannot guarantee segments are semantically meaningful
- Adds complexity to maintaining temporal continuity
- Creates overhead in segment management
- May miss patterns that span multiple segments

## Input Requirements
Temporal segmentation needs:
- Binary activity timeline
- Detected events with timestamps
- Target segment duration preferences
- Minimum/maximum segment size constraints
- Activity score calculations
- Optional: scene change boundaries
- Optional: processing capacity constraints

## Process Description
The segmentation process:
1. Analyze activity timeline for natural boundaries
2. Identify major scene changes as potential split points
3. Calculate activity density over sliding windows
4. Group periods with similar activity levels
5. Apply minimum segment duration constraints
6. Ensure maximum segment size isn't exceeded
7. Align segment boundaries with event boundaries
8. Calculate segment-level statistics:
   - Activity score (0.0-1.0)
   - Primary event types
   - Recommended sampling rate
9. Generate segment list with metadata

## Output Information
Temporal segmentation outputs:
- Segment list with start/end timestamps
- Activity score per segment (0.0-1.0)
- Primary event types in each segment
- Recommended processing priority
- Suggested sampling rate
- Segment duration and frame count
- Inter-segment relationships/dependencies

## Good Expected Outcome
When temporal segmentation works well:
- Creates logical, self-contained video chunks
- Segments align with natural activity patterns
- High-activity segments properly isolated
- Enables 10x faster processing through prioritization
- Supports incremental/progressive analysis
- Facilitates parallel processing workflows

## Bad Unwanted Outcome
When temporal segmentation fails:
- Artificially splits continuous activities
- Creates too many tiny segments
- Produces segments too large for processing
- Loses temporal context between segments
- All segments have similar priority
- Segmentation overhead exceeds benefits
